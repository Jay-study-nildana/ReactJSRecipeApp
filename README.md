# React JS Recipe App

This app does not do anything special as of now. It's a simple react app that shows a recipe.

It uses the create react app command and uses the facebook recommended project structure.

Further, it shows a quick and easy YAML configuration for deploying with Azure Pipelines to an Azure Web App
